Cultural Network and the Future of Cultural Analytics 

 

Abstract: Developing a large-scale research program based on the concept of cultural networks encompassing multiple political and geographic areas as well as historical periods, types of cultural artifacts and representations, would initiate a paradigm shift that could shed light on human history and the relationships between cultural and geographic areas. Similarly, we would be better equipped to understand the dissemination of ideas and cultural phenomena and, in relevant cases (such as in art fairs, universal exhibitions, or Olympic games), we would be able to apply this knowledge to improve the management of current events. With this in mind, we need to integrate our knowledge of objects and people, change the scale of our observation of culture, and take advantage of the new possibilities for data storage and analysis that Big Data techniques offer. The frontiers of our understanding of human beings, history, and cultural evolution are being drawn by cultural networks that we are all connected to. 

 

    Cultural networks: A specific strand of digital research into human culture focuses on the study of particular cultural objects -texts, books, artistic objects, or music- with an emphasis on topics that are related to textuality and language. Another strand focuses on human beings who created these artifacts. It is crucial that the study of objects and people be connected in a way that ensures this emerging body of research is relevant beyond the academic domain of digital humanities. Likewise, researchers must be able to exploit all of its scientific, political and economic potential to understand different questions regarding the past and the present of cultural evolution, migrations, world flow of ideas, and collective behaviors around social media [11]. 

 

A cultural network is a multimodal network in which at least two types of the nodes represent "persons" and "objects", where the links between nodes are semantically loaded with information that is contextually relevant to the domain of research. A cultural network is an abstract construction that connects creators with their own objects, and these objects with other human beings that have come into contact with them by means of proximity, reading, contact, influence, reception, or whichever link is necessary to understand the human context that the network is reconstructing -the past- discovered -the present, or anticipating -the (near) future.
